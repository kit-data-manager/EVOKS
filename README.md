EVOKS (Editor for Vocabularies to Know Semantics) is a software for creating and publishing SKOS vocabularies and thesauri. 
It allows you to:
- create a SKOS vocabulary from scratch
- import SKOS vocabularies in RDF/XML or Turtle format
- edit SKOS vocabularies without using its textual representation
- work collaborativley
- publish the vocabulary with a single click in the vocabulary browser [SKOSMOS](https://www.skosmos.org)

# Installation

The main way to install EVOKS and its depending services is to build and run the docker images locally using docker compose. 
## Prerequisites
* Unix-based system (e.g. Linux, MacOS, Windows using WSL (untested))
* Installation of most recent versions of
    * [git](https://git-scm.com/) 
    * [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (at least docker compose version v2.27.1 needed)

## Installation procedure:

    ```
    user@localhost:/home/user/$ git clone https://github.com/kit-data-manager/EVOKS.git
    Clone to 'EVOKS'
    [...]
    user@localhost:/home/user/$ cd EVOKS
    user@localhost:/home/user/EVOKS$
    ```
2. Copy .example.env and rename to .env
3. Open .env and change the variables if desired, see

## Create an administrator
You need to create an administrator account for EVOKS by performing the following steps:

1. Run `docker ps`, look for `<container_prefix>_web` (or `...web_1`) container
2. Run `docker exec -it <container_prefix>_web bash` (or `...web1` accordingly)
3. Now you are within the container. Run: `python evoks/manage.py createsuperuser`
4. Follow instructions to create a superuser. You can choose whatever username, password and (arbitary) mailaddress you like
5. Log into EVOKS using the email as username and the chosen password

# Further settings (not needed for initial setup)
## Configure Mail Server
1. Open .env file
2. Fill out 
    ```
    EMAIL_HOST_USER=your-email
    EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=your-password
    ``` 
    in this file. **Caution**: Be aware that the password is stored as plain text!
3. Open `evoks/evoks/settings.py` and configure the SMTP server. E.g. for gmail
    ```
    EMAIL_HOST = 'smtp.gmail.com'
    EMAIL_PORT = 587
    EMAIL_USE_TLS = TRUE
    ```

Most of the email providers (e.g. Gmail) do not accept Less Secure Apps by default, so you have to accept Less Secure Apps in the settings of the email you are using.


# For Developers

## Bypass proxy setup for direct access to services and enable Django debug mode:
- Open .env file
- Adjust all variables marked as "(Developers only)" in the [Overview of variables](##Variables). 
`docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up`


## Execution of Tests (only for developers needed)
Run the tests:
`docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.test.yml up --abort-on-container-exit --exit-code-from web`
